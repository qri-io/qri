__qri is a global dataset version control system (GDVCS) built on the distributed web__

Breaking that down:

- **global** so that if *anyone, anywhere* has published work with the same or similar datasets, you can discover it.
- Specific to **datasets** because data deserves purpose-built tools
- **version control** to keep data in sync, attributing all changes to authors
- On the **distributed web** to make *all* of the data published on qri simultaneously available, letting peers work on data together.

If you’re unfamiliar with *version control,* particularly the distributed kind, well you're probably viewing this document on [github](https://github.com/qri-io/qri) — which is a version control system intended for code. Its underlying technology – git – popularized some magic sauce that has inspired a generation of programmers and popularized concepts at the heart of the distributed web. Qri is applying that family of concepts to four common data problems:

1. **Discovery** _Can I find data I’m looking for?_
2. **Trust** _Can I trust what I’ve found?_
3. **Friction** _Can I make this work with my other stuff?_
4. **Sync** _How do I handle changes in data?_

Because qri is *global* and *content-addressed*, adding data to qri also checks the entire network to see if someone has added it before. Since qri is focused solely on datasets, it can provide meaningful search results. Every change on qri is associated with a peer, creating an audit-able trail you can use to quickly see what has changed and who has changed it. All datasets on qri are automatically described at the time of ingest using a flexible schema that makes data naturally inter-operate. Qri comes with tools to turn *all* datasets on the network into a JSON API with a single command. Finally, all changes in qri are tracked & synced.

## Packages

Qri is comprised of many specialized packages. Below you will find a summary of each package.

### Outside Libraries

The following packages are not under Qri, but are important dependencies, so we display their latest versions for convenience.

| Package | Version |
|--------|-------|
| `ipfs` | [![ipfs version](https://img.shields.io/badge/ipfs-v0.4.17-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/) |

<a id="build"></a>
## Building From Source

To build qri you'll need the [go programming language](https://golang.org/dl/) on your machine. We require at least `go` version 1.12 to build qri.

Building then depends upon your operating system:

### Mac OSX

Having `go` installed is enough, proceed to <a href="#building">building</a>.

### Windows

Unfortunately, we do not have distributable single exe releases of `qri` yet, but those are planned. For now, you will need to build `qri` from source.

To start, make sure that you have enabled [Developer Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development). A library that we depend on needs it enabled in order to properly handle symlinks. If not done, you'll likely get the error message "A required privilege is not held by the client".

You should not need to Run As Administrator to build or run `qri`. We do not recommend using administrator to run `qri`.

#### Shell

For your shell, we recommend using [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/). Other shells, such as `cmd`, `Powershell`, or `cygwin` may also be usable, but `msys2` makes it easy to install our required dependencies. IPFS also recommends `msys2`, and `qri` is built on top of IPFS.

#### Dependencies

Building depends upon having `git` and `make` installed. If using `msys2`, you can easily install these by using the package manager "pacman". In a shell, type:

```shell
pacman -S git make
```

Assuming you've also installed `go` using the official Windows installer linked above, you will also need to add `go` to your `PATH` by modifying your environment variable.

#### Environment variables

To set Environment variables, open Windows Settings, and search for "Environment variables". This will open System Properties -> Advanced; on this dialog click "Environment Variables...". Here you can edit `PATH` by adding a new entry. The value of `PATH` is multiple locations on your file system, separated by a semi-colon (;) character. Using the list based editor will insert these semi-colons for you.

Due to how msys2 treats the `PATH` variable, you also need to add a new environment variable `MSYS2_PATH_TYPE`, with the value `inherit`, using the same procedure.

Alternatively, you can assign environment variables by modifying `.bash_profile` in `msys2`. Lookup bash documentation for more information on this approach.

You will also need to set your `GOPATH` using these same methods. Read the next section for more information.

#### Go workspaces

If you are new to developing `go`, you should know that `go` prefers to work a bit differently than most languages. Please read this guide [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html), so that you understand how to create a workspace. Once you have your workspace decided upon, set your `GOPATH` and `PATH` variables setup as described in that guide.

Let's say, for example, that your workspace lives at "c:\Users\me\go", and `go` was installed at "c:\Go". Then you should have your `GOPATH` be equal to "c:\Users\me\go" and your `PATH` something like "...;c:\Go;$GOPATH\bin".

Once these steps are complete, proceed to <a href="#building">building</a>.

### Linux

On a Raspberry PI, you'll need to increase your swap file size in order to build. Normal desktop and server linux OSes should be fine to proceed to <a href="#building">building</a>.

One symptom of having not enough swap space is the `go install` command producing an error message ending with:

```
link: signal: killed
```

To increase your swapfile size, first turn off the swapfile:

```
sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff
```

Then edit `/etc/dphys-swapfile` as root and set `CONF_SWAPSIZE` to 1024.

Finally turn on the swapfile again:

```
sudo dphys-swapfile swapon
```

Otherwise linux machines with reduced memory will have other ways to increase their swap file sizes. Check documentation for your particular machine.

### Building

In your shell, navigate to your `go` workspace, and get the source code for this repository.

```shell
$ cd $GOPATH
$ mkdir -p src/github.com/qri-io
$ cd src/github.com/qri-io
$ git clone https://github.com/qri-io/qri
```

Now enter this main source repo, make sure [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) are enabled, and finally build:

```shell
$ cd qri
$ export GO111MODULE=on
$ make build
```

The `make build` command will have a lot of output. That's good! Its means it's working :)

It'll take a minute, but once everything's finished a new binary `qri` will appear in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory. You should be able to run:

```shell
$ qri help
```
and see help output.
