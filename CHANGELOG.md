# [0.9.8](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.9.7...v0.9.8) (2020-04-20)

0.9.8 is a quick patch release to fix export for a few users who have been having trouble getting certain datasets out of qri.

### Fixed Export
This patch release fixes a problem that was causing some datasets to not export properly while running `qri connect`.

### Naming rules
This patch also clarifies what characters are allowed in a dataset name and a peername. From now on a legal dataset name and username must:
* consist of only lowercase letters, numbers 0-9, the hyphen "-", and the underscore "_".
* start with a letter

Length limits vary between usernames and dataset names, but qri now enforces these rules more consistently. Existing dataset names that violate these rules will continue to work, but will be forced to rename in a future version. New datasets with names that don't match these rules cannot be created.

### Bug Fixes

* **checkout:** checkout fails early if link exists ([b8f697f](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/b8f697f))
* **cmd:** checkout supports specifying a directory ([3406c8a](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/3406c8a))
* **cmd:** completion supports config, structure and peer args, added workdir ([#1268](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/issues/1268)) ([ef62c71](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/ef62c71))
* **cmd:** tty should auto disable color for windows ([abf678d](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/abf678d))
* **export:** handle ok-case of bad viz while connected ([1bb2463](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/1bb2463))
* **log:** Timeout log retrieval so it won't hang ([14d885a](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/14d885a))
* **parse:** Allow hyphens in usernames and dataset names ([c3b616a](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/c3b616a))
* **setup:** Detect colors during init, which fixes setup ([278241c](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/278241c))
* **setup:** Don't crash when running `qri setup` ([e0202f4](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/e0202f4))

# [0.9.7](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.9.6...v0.9.7) (2020-04-07)

aka `midnight_blue_sloughi`

Qri CLI v0.9.7 is **huge**. This release adds SQL support, turning Qri into an ever-growing database of open datasets.

If that wasn't enough, we've added tab completion, nicer automatic commit messages, unified our command descriptions, and fixed a whole slew of bugs!

## üìä Run SQL on datasets

Exprimental support for SQL is here! Landing this feature brings qri full circle to the [original whitepaper](http://qri.io/papers/deterministic-querying) we published in 2017. 

We want to live in a world where you can `SELECT * FROM any_qri_dataset`, and we're delighted to say that day is here. 

We have plans to improve & build upon this crucial feature, and are marking it as experimental while we flesh out our SQL implemetation. We'll drop the "experimental" flag when we support a healthy subset of the SQL spec.

We've been talking about SQL a bunch in our community calls:
* [üé¶ introducing SQL support](https://youtu.be/_kvwuZbnyV4?t=2030) 
* [üé¶ qri as a global SQL database](https://youtu.be/U6FoBaO0tYM?t=1612)
* [üé¶ SQL errors & prepping datasets for querying](https://youtu.be/D5zUIS_v0iY?t=242)


## üöóüèÅ Autocomplete 

The name says it all. after following the instructions on `qri generate --help`, type `qri get`, then press tab, and _voil√°_, your list of datasets appears for the choosing. This makes working with datasets much easier, requiring you to remember and type less. [üé¶ Here's](https://youtu.be/ROkxdM2pRgY?t=145) a demo from our community call.


## ü§ùüìì Friendlier Automatic Commit Messages

For a long time Qri has automatically generated commit messages for you if one isn't suppied by analyzing what's changed between versions. This release makes titles that look like this:

```
updated structure, viz, and transform
```

and adds detailed messages that look like this:
```
structure:
    updated schema.items.items.63.title
viz:
    updated scriptPath
transform:
    updated resources./ipfs/QmfQu6qBS3iJEE3ohUnhejb7vh5KwcS5j4pvNxZMi717pU.path
    added scriptBytes
    updated syntaxVersion
```

These automatic messages form a nice textual description of what's changed from version to version. Qri will automatically add these if you don't provide `--title` and/or `--message` values to `qri save`.

## üìô Uniform CLI help

Finally, a big shout out to one of our biggest open source contributions to date! @Mr0Grog not only contributed a massive cleanup of our command line help text, they also wrote a [style guide](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#cli-help-style) based on the existing help text for others to follow in the future!

# [v0.9.2](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.9.1...v0.9.2) (2019-11-18)

In this patch release we're fixing a bunch of tiny bugs centered around removing datasets, and adding methods for column statistics

## üìä Get to know your data with stats
This release adds support for stats calculation. The easiest way to see stats is to `get` 'em:

```
$ qri get stats me/dataset

# getting stats also works in an FSI-linked directory
# so you can drop the dataset reference & just type:
$ cd /path/to/linked/dataset/directory
$ qri get stats
```

In both cases you'll get a JSON document of stats, with one stat aggregating each column in your datsaet. The type of stat created depends on the data type being aggregated. Here's the table of stats calculated so far:

# [0.9.1](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.9.0...v0.9.1) (2019-11-05)

This release brings first-class support for Readmes, adds a bunch of stability, and sets the table for exciting collaboration features in the future.

### üìÑ Qri now supports readme!
This release brings support for a new dataset component, readmes! Following in a long tradition of readme's in the world of software. Readme's are [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) documents for explaining your dataset in human terms.

The easiest way to create a readme is by creating a file called `readme.md` in an FSI-linked directory. Qri will pick up on the file & add it to your dataset. You can see what the rendered HTML version looks like by running `qri render` in an FSI-linked directory.

In the future, we're excited to build out the feature set readme's offer, and think they're a better long-term fit for us than the generic notion of our existing `viz` component. Readme's differ from viz by not allowing generic script inclusion, which allows us to present them in a safer sandbox-like environment. This fits well with our story around transform scripts and the general expectation that scripts Qri interacts with will come with a safer execution properties. 

With this release, support for readme's in [qri.cloud](https://qri.cloud) and [desktop](https://qri.io/desktop) is right around the corner.

Happy note taking!

### üìò Introducing Logbook

**[video!](https://youtu.be/WBshhfYv740?t=206)**

Until now qri has used stored datasets as it's source of history. Qri keeps commit information in the dataset itself, and creates a log of datasets by having each dataset reference the one before it. Keeping commits in history has a number of advantages:
* all datasets are attributed to the user that made them
* all datasets have an accurate creation timestamp
* all datasets include any notes the author made at the time
* all of these these details are _part of the dataset_, and move with it.

We've gone a long way with this simplistic apporoach, but using datasets as the only source of history has one major limitation: _the history of a dataset is tied to the data itself_. This means you can't uncover the full history of a dataset unless you have _all_ versions of a dataset _stored locally_. Logbook fixes that problem.

Logbook is a _coordination tool_ for talking about who did what, without having to move around the data itself. This means Qri can tell you meaningful things about dataset versions you don't have. This will make syncing faster, and forms the basis for _collaboration_. 

To make use of logbook, all you have to do is... nothing! Logbook is a transparent service that overlays onto traditional Qri commands. You'll see some new details in commands like `qri log` and a few new plumbing commands like `qri fetch` and `qri logbook`, but this feature adds no new requirements to the Qri workflow.

We're most excited about what logbook allows us to do (collaboration!), and can't wait to ship features that will show the benefit of logbook. More fun soon!

# [0.9.0](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.9.0-alpha...v0.9.0) (2019-09-26)

0.9.0 makes Qri work like Git! 

# :open_file_folder: File System Integration [(RFC0025)](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0025-filesystem-integration.md)
This release brings a few new commands into qri. If you're a [git](https://git-scm.com) user, these will look familiar:

```
init        initialize a dataset directory
checkout    checkout creates a linked directory and writes dataset files to that directory
status      Show status of working directory
restore     restore returns part or all of a dataset to a previous state
```

You can now interact with a versioned dataset in similar way you would a git repository. Now creating new versions is as simple as `cd`ing to a linked directory and typing `qri save`.

After a lot of thought & research, we've come to believe that using the filesystem as an interface is a great way to interact with versioned data. Git has been doing this for some time, and we've put thought & care into bringing the aspects of git that work well in this context. 

Running the new `qri init` command will create an _FSI-linked directory_. A new datset will be created in your qri repo, and a hidden file called `.qri-ref` will be created in the folder you've initialized within. When you're linked directory you no longer need to type the name of a dataset to interact with it. `qri get body peername/dataset_name` is just `qri get body` when you're in an FSI-linked directory. You can see which datasets are linked when you `qri list`, it'll show the folder it's linked to.

Unlike git, qri doesn't track _all_ files in a linked folder. Instead it only looks for specific filenames to map to dataset components:

| component | possible filename                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------|
| body      | `body.csv`, `body.json`, `body.xlsx`, `body.cbor`   |
| meta      | `meta.json`, `meta.yaml`                            |
| schema    | `schema.json`, `schema.yaml`                        |

We'll be following up with support for transform and viz components shortly. It's still possible to create datasets that _don't_ have a link to the filesystem, and indeed this is still the better way to go for large datasets.

File system integration opens up a whole bunch of opportunities for integration with other tools by dropping back to a common interface: files. Now you can use whatever software you'd like to edit dataset files, and by writing back to that folder with one of these name you're ready to version from the get go. command like `qri status` make it easy to keep track of where you are in your work, and `qri restore` makes it easy to "reset to head".


# :desktop_computer: [Qri Desktop](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop)
This is the first qri release that will be bundled into Qri Desktop, our brand new project for working with datasets. Qri desktop puts a face on qri, We'll be cutting a release of qri desktop shortly. Check it out!

# :cloud: qri.cloud as a new default registry

This release also puts a bunch of work into the registry. We've made the job of a registry smaller, moving much of the behaviour of dataset syncing into _remotes_, which any peer can now become. At the same time, we're hard at work building qri.cloud, our new hosted service for dataset management and collaboration. If you're coming from a prior version of qri, run the following to swich to the new registry:

```
qri config set registry.location https://registry.qri.cloud
```

Now when you `qri publish`, it'll go to qri.cloud. _Lots_ of exciting things coming for qri cloud in the next few months.

# [0.9.0-alpha](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.8.2...v0.9.0-alpha) (2019-09-04)

# Preparing for 0.9.0
We're not quite ready to put the seal-of-approval on 0.9.0, but it's been more than a few months since we cut a release. This alpha-edition splits the difference while we prepare for a full & proper 0.9.0. The forthcoming big ticket item will be _File System Integration_ [(RFC0025)](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0025-filesystem-integration.md), which dramatically simplifies the story around integrating with a version-controlled dataset.

So while this isn't a proper release, the changelog gives a feel for just how much work is included this go-round. More soon!

# [0.8.2](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.8.1...v0.8.2) (2019-06-25)


Version 0.8.2 is a patch release that improves qri's command-line client in numerous small ways

## Webapp
* Multiple problems were fixed around webapp fetching, saving, and pinning. The general end-user experience was also improved by allowing the frontend to show an interstitial screen while the backend was fetching the webapp.

## Stdout / stderr usage
* Many related issues around stdout and stderr usage were fixed, such as missing endlines being added, and prompts meant to always be seen were moved to stderr.

## Misc
* `qri get` gained a flag `--pretty` to pretty-print json.
* `qri save` with the strict flag set will produce an error if it fails to validate
* `qri add` can use a full reference to specify which version to add


### Bug Fixes

* **add:** add specific versions of a dataset using the full reference ([4b1e562](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/4b1e562))
* **config:** `config.Copy()` copies over the path ([2fd3420](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/2fd3420))
* **secrets:** Write secrets warning to stderr instead of stdout ([b43a4b7](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/b43a4b7))
* **unpublish:** Add endline when printing message ([#810](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/issues/810)) ([0ced201](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/0ced201))
* **validate:** Allow validate to run when connected ([#808](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/issues/808)) ([dedc0c5](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/dedc0c5))
* **webapp:** resolve webapp path before passing path to the handler ([f38dcf4](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/f38dcf4))
* **webapp loading:** pin webapp from dweb, send temporary script if loading ([4fb2921](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/4fb2921))


### Code Refactoring

* **cmd:** remove ephemeral `qri connect` flags ([8620aa0](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/8620aa0))


### Features

* **pretty:** Pretty flag for get command ([b6f579b](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/b6f579b))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **cmd:** removes:

`--disconnect-after`
`--disable-api`
`--disable-rpc`
`--disable-webapp`
`--disable-p2p`
`--read-only`
`--remote-mode`

These can be configured instead by using the `qri config` command

Removing these temporary flags let's us better reason about the state of the config at any time, as well as helps us be confident that at any time we are not saving over our config with false information.



<a name="v0.8.1"></a>
# [v0.8.1](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.8.0...v) (2019-06-11)

This patch release fixes a small-but-critical bug that prevented `qri setup` from working. A few other fixes & bumps made it in, but the main goal was restoring `qri setup` so folks can, you know, set qri up.

### Bug Fixes

* **diff:** return source data in diff response ([d1d2da5](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/d1d2da5))



<a name="0.8.0"></a>
# [0.8.0](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.7.3...v0.8.0) (2019-06-05)

Version 0.8.0 is our best-effort to close out the first set of public features.

## Automatic Updates ([RFC0024](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0024-scheduled-updates.md))
Qri can now keep your data up to date for you.  0.8.0 overhauls `qri update` into a service that schedules & runs updates in the background on your computer. Qri runs datasets and maintains a log of changes.

### schedule shell scripts
Scheduling datasets that have starlark transforms is the ideal workflow in terms of portability, but a new set of use cases open by adding the capacity to schedule & execute shell scripts within the same cron environment. 

## Starlark changes
We've made two major changes, and one small API-breaking change. Bad news first:

### `ds.set_body` has different optional arguments
`ds.set_body(csv_string, raw=True, data_format="csv")` is now `ds.set_body(csv_string, parse_as="csv")`. We think think this makes more sense, and that the previous API was confusing enough that we needed to completely deprecate it. Any prior transform scripts that used `raw` or `data_format` arguments will need to update.

### new beautiful soup-like HTML package
Our `html` package is difficult to use, and we plan to deprecate it in a future release. In it's place we've introduced `bsoup`, a new package that implements parts of the [beautiful soup 4 api](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4). It's _much_ easier use, and will be familiar to anyone coming from the world of python.


### the "ds" passed to a transform is now the previous dataset version
The `ds` that's passed to is now the existing dataset, awaiting transformation. For technical reasons, `ds` used to be a blank dataset. In this version we've addressed those issues, which makes examining the current state a dataset possible without any extra `load_dataset` work. This  makes things like append-only datasets a one-liner:

```python
def transform(ds,ctx):
  ds.set_body(ds.get_body().append(["new row"]))
```

### CLI uses '$PAGER' on POSIX systems
Lots of Qri output is, well, long, so we now check for the presence of the `$PAGER` environment variable and use it to show "scrolling" data where appropriate. While we're at it we've cleaned up  output to make things a little more readable. Windows should be unaffected by this change. If you ever want to _avoid_ pagination, I find the easiest way to do so is by piping to `cat`. For example:
```
$ qri ls | cat
```
Happy paging!

### Switch to go modules
Our project has now switched entirely to using go modules. In the process we've deprecated `gx`, the distributed package manager we formerly used to fetch qri dependencies. This should dramatically simplify the process of building Qri from source by bringing dependency management into alignment with idiomatic go practices.

### Dataset Strict mode
`dataset.structure` has a new boolean field: `strict`. If `strict` is `true`, a dataset _must_ pass validation against the specified schema in order to save. When a dataset Dataset is in strict mode, Qri can assume that all data in the body is valid. Being able to make this assumption will allow us to provide additional functionality and performance speedups in the future. If your dataset has no errors, be sure to set `strict` to `true`.

# [0.7.3](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.7.2...v0.7.3) (2019-04-03)

This release is all about 3 Rs:
* Rendering
* Remotes
* `load_dataset`

This release we've focused on improving dataset visualiing, setting the stage with better defaults and a cleaner API for creating custom viz. We think expressing dataset vizualiations as self-contained `html` makes Qri datasets an order of magnitude more useful, and can't wait for you to try it.

Along with the usual bug fixes, a few nice bonuses have landed, like supplying [multiple `--file` args](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/pull/718) to qri save to combine dataset input files, and `qri get rendered` to show rendered viz. Anyway, on to the big stuff:

### Default Rendering ([RFC0011](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0011-html_viz.md))
Whenever you create a new dataset version, Qri will now create a default viz component if you don't provide one. Unless run with `--no-render`, Qri will now execute that template, and store the result in a file called `index.html` in your dataset. This makes your dataset _much_ more fun when viewed directly on the d.web, which is outside of Qri entirely.

This is because IPFS HTTP gateways are sensitive to `index.html`. When you use qri to make a dataset, your dataset comes with a self-contained visualization that others can see without downloading Qri at all.

We think this dramatically increases the usefulness of a dataset, and increases the chances that others will want to share & disseminate your work by making your dataset a more-complete offering in the data value chain. These embedded default visualizations drop the time it takes to create a readable dataset to one step.

That being said, we've intentionally made the default visualization rather bland. The reason for this is twofold. First, to keep the file size of the `index.html` small (less than 1KB). Second, we want you to customize it. We'll refine the default template over time, but we hope you'll use viz to tell a story with your data.

Users may understandably want to disable default vizualizations. To achieve this `qri save` and `qri update` have a new flag: `--no-render`. No render will prevent the execution of any viz template. This will save ~1KB per version, at the cost of usability.

### Overhauled HTML Template API ([RFC0011](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0011-html_viz.md#template-api))
Keeping with the theme of better viz, we've also taken time to overhaul our template API. Given that this is a public API, we took some time to think about what it would mean to try to render Qri templates _outside_ of our go implementation. While no code does this today, we wanted to make sure it would be easier in the future, so we took steps to define an API that generally avoids use of the go templating `.`, instead presenting a `ds` object with json-case accessors. Taking things like this:

```
<h1>{{ .Meta.Title }}</h1>
```
to this: 
```
<h1>{{ ds.meta.title }}</h1>
```

This change brings the template syntax closer to the way we work with datasets in other places (eg: in `dataset.yaml` files and starlark transform scripts), which should help cut down on the mental overhead of working with a dataset in all these locations. We think this up-front work on our template API will make it easier to start writing custom templates. We don't have docs up yet, but the RFC [reference](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0011-html_viz.md#reference-level-explanation) section outlines the API in detail.

### Experimental Remote Mode ([RFC0022](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0022-remotes.md))
The registry is nice and all, but we need more ways to push data around. In this release we're launching a new expriment called "remotes" that start into this work. Remotes act as a way for any user of Qri to setup their own server that keeps datasets alive, providing availability and ownership over data within a set of nodes that they control.

Currently we consider this feature "advanced only" as it comes with a number of warnings and some special setup configuration. For more info, [check the RFC](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0022-remotes.md), and if you're interested in running a remote, [hop on discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/etap8Gb) and say "hey I want to run a remote".


### Starlark `load_dataset` ([RFC0023](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0023-starlark_load_dataset.md))
We've made a breaking API change in Starlark that deprecates `qri.load_dataset_body`, and introduce a new global function: `load_dataset`. This new API makes it clear that `load_dataset` both loads the dataset and declares it as a dependency of this script. This is an important step toward making datasets a first-class citizen in the qri ecosystem. Here's an example of the new syntax:

```python
load("http.star", "http")

# load a dataset into a variable named "fhv"
fhv = load_dataset("b5/nyc_for_hire_vehicles")

def download(ctx):
  # use the fhv dataset to inform an http request
  vins = ["%s,%s" % (entry['vin'], entry['model_yearl']), for entry in fhv.body()]

  res = http.post("https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/DecodeVINValuesBatch/", form_body={
    'format': 'JSON', 
    'DATA': vins.join(";")
  })

  return res.json()

def transform(ds, ctx):
  ds.set_body(ctx.download)
```

Users who were previously using `qri.load_dataset_body` will need to update their scripts to use the new syntax. The easiest way to do that is by adding a new version to your dataset history with the updated script:
```
$ qri get transform.script me/dataset > transform.star
# make updates to transform.star file & save
$ qri save --file transform.script me/dataset
```
Three easy steps, and your dataset log tells the story of the upgrade.

# [0.7.2](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.7.1...v0.7.2) (2019-03-14)


### Better piping for `qri save`
Minor set of fixes aimed at making the command line work better. The biggest command we've fixed is `qri save --dry-run`. Qri now properly routes diagnostic output to `stderr` (things like the spinner, transform exectution, and completion messages), while sending the _result_ of the dry run to `stdout`. This makes the following much more powerful:

`qri save --dry-run --file transform.star me/dataset > dry_run_output.json`

If save works, the `dry_run_output.json` will now be a valid `json` file representing the result of the dry run, and you'll still see progress output in your terminal window. We'll be working to bring this separation of diagnostic & results output to all commands in the near future.

### Run transforms directly with the `--file` flag
One other small note, if you feed a file that ends in `.star` to `qri save --file`, Qri will assume you mean it to be a transform script, and execute it as such. This cuts out the need for a `dataset.yaml` file, and makes working with transforms a little easier to reason about. If you need to provide configuration details to the transform, you'll still need to create a `dataset.yaml` file & specify your `.star` file there.


### Bug Fixes

* **get:** better defaults for get body. ([5631d08](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/5631d08))
* **stderr:** write save diagnostic output to stderr ([3dac8b8](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/3dac8b8))


### Features

* **ReadDatasetFile:** infer .star & .html files to be bare tf & vz components ([89fcba8](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/89fcba8))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **get:** cli body command is now removed



<a name="0.7.1"></a>
# [0.7.1](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1) (2019-03-07)

0.7.1 is on the larger side for a patch release, shipping fixes & features aimed at doing more with datasets. With this release qri is better at comparing data, and more flexible when it comes to both saving & exporting data.

### Overhauled Diff
We've completely overhauled our `diff` command, using a new algorithm that's capable of diffing large volumes of structured data quickly. We've also adjusted the command itself to work with structured data both inside and outside of qri.

Two caveats come with this new feature:
* This code is new. We have tests that show our differ produces _valid_ diff scripts, but sometimes diff doesn't produce diffs that are fun to read. We'd love your feedback on improving the new diff command.
* We haven't really figured out a proper way to _visualize_ these diffs yet.

Caveats aside, new diff is mad decent. Here's a few examples:

```
# get more info on diff:
$ qri diff --help

# diff dataset body against it's previous version:
$ qri diff body me/annual_pop

# diff two dataset meta sections:
$ qri diff meta me/population_2016 me/population_2017

# diff two local json files:
$ qri diff a.json b.json

# diff a json & a csv file:
$ qri diff data.csv b.json

# output diff as json
$ qri diff a.json b.json --format json

# print just a diff summary
$ qri diff me/annual_pop --summary
```

### Revamped Export
We've overhauled our export command to up it's utility. We've also introduced the terms "foreign" and "native" export to refer to the _fidelity_ of an export. This round of improvements has focused on foreign exports, which converts qri datasets into common formats. For example, now you can (finally) express a complete dataset as json:

```
$ qri export --format json me/annual_pop
```

We've also made the role `qri export` plays work better in relation to `qri get`. If you want a _complete_ dataset, use `qri export`. If you want a piece of a dataset (for example, just the body), use `qri dataset`.


### Shorthand Save Files

We've added a way to save changes to datasets that only affect individual components. If you only want to change, say the meta section of a dataset, you can now create a file that only affects the meta component. In the past,  you'd have no choice but to construct a complete dataset document, and only alter the `meta` section. Instead you can now save a file like this:

```json
{
  "qri": "md:0", // this "md:0" value for the "qri" key tells qri this only affects meta
  "title" : "this is a new title",
  "description": "new decription"
}
```

and give that to save:
`$ qri save --file meta.json me/dataset`

Qri will interpret this file and apply the changes to the meta component. This pairs very nicely with `qri get` to make workflows that only affect specific components, you could use this to change a dataset's schema, which lives in the `structure` component:
```
$ qri get structure me/annual_pop  > structure.yaml

# save changes to structure.yaml

$ qri save --file structure.yaml me/annual_pop
```

### Starlark improvements:
We've added a `json` package to starlark, and given `math` a new method `round()`, which is not built into starlark as a language primtive. If you want to round numbers in starlark scripts, do this:

```python
load("math.star", "math")

print(math.round(3.5)) # prints: 4
```

### Fixes
We've also shipped a bunch of little bug fixes that should add up to a better experience. All the changes described above also apply to the qri JSON api as well. Happy versioning!

<a name="0.7.0"></a>
# [0.7.0](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.6.2...v0.7.0) (2019-02-05)

We've bumped this release to 0.7.0 to reflect some major-league refactoring going on deeper in the stack. The main goal of this release has been to drive stability up, and put the Qri codebase on firmer foundation for refinement.

### Major Stability Improvements
Much of our refactoring has gone into removing & consolidating code, making it easier reason about. The effect of this are fewer unintended interactions between different subsystems, resulting in a version of qri that behaves much better, especially in the corner cases. All of these improvements are made on both the JSON API, the CLI, _and_ while operating over RPC (we use RPC when `qri connect` is running in another terminal).
 
Commands like `qri get` and `qri export` in particular work consistently, and can be used to greater effect. For example, running `qri use` on a dataset let's you drop the repeated typing of a dataset name, and play with `get` to explore the dataset faster:
```
$ qri use me/dataset
$ qri get meta --format yaml
$ qri get body --format json --limit 20 --offset 3
```

It's much to fetch scripts with `get` and write them to a file for local work:
```
$ qri get transform.script > transform.star
```

Speaking of transforms, `qri update` on a local dataset is now true alias for `qri save --recall=tf`. Eliminating the alternate codepath for `qri update` has made update work far better for re-running transforms.

Export now has a far friendlier `--format` flag for getting a dataset document into a common data format. This'll give you a JSON interpretation of your dataset:
```
qri export --format=json me/dataset
```

We're inching closer to our overall goal of building Qri into a series of well-composed packages with a cohesive user interface. Lots more work to do, partly because there's more that we _can_ do now that our code is better composed. We'd encourage you to play with the CLI if you haven't yet taken it for a spin.

### XLSX support
Along with the improved export command, we now have early support for Excel `.xlsx` documents! this now works:
```
qri export --format=xlsx peer/dataset
``` 

this now works too (so long as there's a sheet named "sheet1"), and an existing history in another format like JSON, CSV, or CBOR:
```
qri save --body dataset.xlsx --keep-format peer/dataset
```
Lots of work to do here, but early support for excel is an exciting addition.


### Bug Fixes

* **get:** Datasets whose name contains a field should work with get ([97410fb](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/97410fb))
* **get:** Fix get command using a dotted path ([c130349](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/c130349))
* **get:** Turn `body` into a selector of the `get` command ([7793845](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/7793845))
* **local update:** rework local update to be a type of save ([fa9ca11](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/fa9ca11))
* **save:** Improve error message if new ds has no body or structure ([31332fd](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/31332fd))
* **save:** Infer more values, such as Schema, when appropriate ([1c95539](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/1c95539))


### Features

* **export:** initial foreign export support ([9382483](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/9382483))
* **get:** support getting script file fields ([da8ae46](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/da8ae46))



<a name="0.6.2"></a>
# [0.6.2](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.6.1...v0.6.2) (2019-01-22)

0.6.2 is mainly about squashing bugs, but there are three fun new features worth noting:

### :globe_with_meridians: IPFS HTTP API Support
Given that all Qri nodes currently run IPFS under the hood, it's sad that Qri doesn't expose the full power of IPFS while running. We've fixed that by adding new configuration options to enable the IPFS HTTP API. This lets you use the `ipfs` binary to use IPFS while qri is running. We've added support for toggling IPFS pubsub as well. By default new installations of Qri come with the IPFS api enabled, and pubsub disabled.

To enable both, change your Qri config.yaml `store` to include the new options flags:

```yaml
store:
  type: "ipfs"
  options:
    # when api is true, Qri will use the IPFS config to spin up an HTTP API
    # at whatever port your IPFS repo is configured for
    # (the configuration in IPFS is "Addresses.API", defaults to localhost:5001)
    api: true
    # optional, when true running "qri connect" will also enable IPFS pubsub 
    # as if `ipfs daemon --enable-pubsub-experiment` were run
    pubsub: true
```

With these settings you can run `qri connect` in one terminal, and then run (nearly) any regular IPFS command in another terminal with `ipfs --api /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001/ [command]`. Having both IPFS & Qri work at once makes life much easier for anyone who needs access to both functionalities at once.

### :world_map: Starlark Geo Support
We're very excited to land initial support for a geospatial module in Starlark. Considering just how much open data is geospatial, we're very excited to play with this :) [Here's an example transform script](https://gist.github.com/b5/7fc378b6ee504e929ab390bca8f038f6) to get started.

### :1234: Remove now supports any number of revisions
Previously, it was only possible to reomve _entire dataset histories_, which is, well, not ideal. We've changed the way remove works so you can now choose how many revisions (dataset versions) to delete. `qri remove --revisions 1 me/dataset_name` is basically an undo button, while `qri remove --all me/dataset_name` will delete the entire dataset. This also applies to the API, by supplying a now-required `revisions` query param.



### Bug Fixes

* **cmd:** Both body and setup runnable during "qri connect" ([0a9c93a](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/0a9c93a))
* **cmd.Export:** handle -o flag on export to get target directory ([0064715](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/0064715))
* **export:** Check for unsupported export flags, recognize --format ([aea27de](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/aea27de))
* **export:** Export can be used while running `qri connect` ([a5a56d1](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/a5a56d1))
* **export:** Flag is --zip instead of --zipped, api format form value ([f370632](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/f370632))
* **export:** Write exported file to pwd where command is run. ([b62f739](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/b62f739))
* **list:** Listing a non-existent profile should not crash ([e00d516](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/e00d516))
* **p2p dataset info:** return not found if dataset doesn't populate ([b55af2a](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/b55af2a))
* **print:** Use int64 in print in order to support Arm6 (Raspberry Pi). ([64fcbc4](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/64fcbc4))
* **remove:** Flag --all as an alias for --revisions=all. More tests ([7e29002](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/7e29002))
* **remove:** Remove requires the --revisions to specify what to delete ([02a0b02](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/02a0b02))
* **Save:** add tests to cmd that test you can save a transform and viz ([#649](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/issues/649)) ([42410a5](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/42410a5))


### Features

* **api:** always include script output in POST /dataset responses ([ee32e44](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/ee32e44))
* **config.Store:** support store options to enable ipfs api & pubsub ([e76b9f8](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/e76b9f8)), closes [#162](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/issues/162) [#658](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/issues/658)



<a name="0.6.1"></a>
# [0.6.1](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1) (2018-12-12)

For a patch release, 0.6.1 is on the larger side. After cutting the 0.6.0 release, we realized that NAT traversal issues were preventing Qri from working in a consistent, performant way. Basically, peers aren't seeing each other, and despite tools for building & maintaining direct connections with Qri peers, data transfer isn't performing in a way that's comparable with "git+github". To compensate for this, we're focusing on making publishing to the registry consistent & reliable, and using the registry to reduce our reliance on p2p connections. The result is Qri has a fast path that works with the registry for many dataset transfer commands, but still uses p2p whenever possible.

In the coming months we'll continue to iterate these solutions toward each other, making our p2p technology faster & more reliable, while keeping these "fast-paths" for point-to-point dataset transfer.

0.6.1 No breaking changes, but some behaviours are different. The biggie is `qri publish` now takes a few extra steps.

### :racing_car: Faster, dependable Publish & Add
Our big focus has been on making dataset transfer to the registry fast & reliable. The end result is `qri publish` and `qri add` now feels a _lot_ more like `git push` and `git fetch`. We're using our shiny new [dag package](https://github.com/qri-io/dag) to do a transfer of raw IPFS blocks directly. Look for us to expand & improve the use of this (open source) secret sauce for a more performant Qri experience.

### :mag: Search is restored!
`qri search` is back! It works with the registry! Try running `qri search foo` and `qri add` with one of the results!

### Bug Fixes

* **actions.ResolveDatasetRef:** temp fix to keep incomplete ref responses from resolve ([b284228](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/b284228))

# [0.6.0](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.5.6...v0.6.0) (2018-11-09)

Version 0.6.0 is a **big** 'ol release. Lots of changes that have taken close to a month to land. Test coverage is up, but expect us to have broken a bunch of things. We'll be rapidly iterating over the coming weeks to make sure everything works the way it should.

This release marks turning a corner for the Qri project as a whole. We have a new look for the frontend, and have rounded out an initial feature set we think will take Qri out of the realm of "experimental" and into the world of dependable, usable code. It's taken a great deal of time, effort, and research. I'm _very_ thankful/proud/excited for all who have contributed to this release, and can't wait to start showing off this newest verion. Here's some of the highlights, with a full changelog below.

### :heart: We've adopted the RFC process
I'm delighted to say Qri's feature development is now driven by a request-for-comments process. You can read about new features we're considering and implementing, as well as make suggestions over at our RFC repo. From this release forward, we'll note the biggest RFCs that have landed in release notes.


### Overhauled, more capable starlark transform functions, renamed everything from "skylark" to "starlark" [(RFC0016)](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0016-revise_transform_processing.md)
We've overhauled the way transform functions are called to provide greater flexibility between function calls to allow sidecar state to travel from special functions, and unified all transforms around the `transform` special function. here's an example:

```python
load("http.star", "http")
def download(ctx):
  res = http.get("https://api.github.com/")
  return res.json()

def transform(ds, ctx):
  ds.set_body(ctx.download)
```

The passed in dataset is now properly set to the most recent snapshot thanks to our improved transform logic. More on that below.

### `.zip` export & import [(RFC0014)](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0014-export.md)
The following now works:
```
$ qri export me/my_dataset
exported my_dataset.zip

# on some other qri repo:
$ qri save --file=my_dataset.zip
```
This makes it possible to send around Qri datasets without using the p2p network. It even works when the zip is posted to a url:
```
$ qri save --file=https://dropbox.com/.../my_dataset.zip
```

We think this is a big win for portability. We'll be working on exporting to different file formats in the coming weeks.


### Publish & Update [(RFC0018)](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0018-publish-update.md)
Qri now gives you control over which datasets of your will be listed for others to see using `qri publish`. This does mean you need to publish a datset before others will see it listed. **This does not mean that data added to Qri is private**. It's better to think of data you've added to qri that isn't published as 'unlisted'. If you gave someone the hash of your dataset, they could add it with `qri add`, but users who list your datasets over p2p won't see your unlisted work. If you want private data, for now Qri isn't the right tool, but now you have more control over what users see when they visit your profile.

We now also have our first real mechanism for automated synchronization: update. Update works on both your own datasets and other people's. Running update on your own dataset will re-run the most recent transform and generate a new dataset version if Qri detects a change. Running update on a peer's dataset will check to see if they're online, and if they are, update will fast-forward your copy of their dataset to the latest version.

### New and Save have merged [(RFC0017)](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0017-define_dataset_creation.md)
The `new` and `save` commands (and API endpoints) have merged into just `save`. New wasn't doing too much for us, so we're hoping to get down to one keyword for all modifications that aren't re-running transform scripts.

### Deterministic Transforms & Overhauled Dataset Creation [(RFC0020)](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0020-distingush_manual_vs_scripted_transforms.md)
We've completely overhauled the process of saving a datset, clarifying the mental model by distinguishing between _manual_ and _scripted_ transformations. The process of creating a dataset is now easier to understand and predict. We'll be working in the coming weeks to properly document how this works, but the first form of documentation we've landed are error messages that help clarify when an issue arises.

# [0.5.6](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.5.5...v0.5.6) (2018-10-10)

### :two_women_holding_hands: Peer Sharing Fixes & Slightly better export

This patch release is focused on making inroads on some long-standing issues with peer discovery. We've added tests & a few fixes that should help peers get connected and stay connected. This is an area of active work that we'll be adding more improvements to in the future.

We've also standardized our export format with a newly-approved [export rfc](https://github.com/qri-io/rfcs/blob/master/text/0014-export.md), which fixes a few issues with the way Qri exports .zip archives. exports should now be complete archives that we'll start using for import in a forthcoming release.

### Bug Fixes

* **export:** Blank yaml file should have correct fields ([15484c0](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/15484c0))
* **new:** Take absolute path to body file before loading it in `new`. ([b9afcd0](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/b9afcd0))

<a name="0.5.5"></a>
# [0.5.5](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.5.4...v0.5.5) (2018-10-05)

Version 0.5.5 is a patch release with some small features and a few bugfixes. It's mainly here because @b5 wants
to play with .zip files & regexes in transform scripts.

### :package: Skylark `re` and `zip` packages
We've added two new small, bare-bones packages to skylark to handle common-yet-vital use cases:
`re` brings basic support regular expressions, and `zip` brings read-only capacity to open zip archives.
Both of these are rather utility-oriented, but _very_ importnat when opening & cleaning data.

### :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Upcoming switch from "skylark" to "starlark"
Speaking of skylark, google has landed on a rename for their project, and it'll hence-fourth be named "starlark".
As such we'll be making the switch to this terminology in an upcoming release. Our package names will be changing
from `.sky` to some new file extension, which will be a breaking change for all tranforms that import `.sky` packages.
We'll keep you posted.

### Features

* **RequestDatasetLog:** add back functionality for getting a peer's dataset log over p2p ([813bf0d](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/813bf0d))
* **RequestDatasetLog:** handle non-local datasets, rename lots of vars ([248e02e](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/248e02e))

# [0.5.4](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.5.3...v0.5.4) (2018-10-01)

### :wrench: minor patch release
0.5.4 is a _very_ minor release that cleans up a few issues with our API to make the frontend editor work :smile:

### Features

* **ConvertBodyFile:** extracted actions.ConvertBodyFile from LookupBody func ([d8a7f77](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/d8a7f77))



<a name="0.5.3"></a>
# [0.5.3](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.5.2...v0.5.3) (2018-09-24)

### :running_woman: Dry Run
0.5.3 is a minor version bump that introduces a new `--dry-run` flag on `qri new` and `qri save` that'll run new/save _without committing changes_. We've added the same thing on the api using a query param: `dry_run=true`. Dry runs are fun! use 'em to experiment with different input without having to constantly delete stuff.

### Bug Fixes

* **dsgraph:** fix breaking change from dataset pkg ([0954513](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/0954513))


### Features

* **api dry run:** add dry run & moar file options to /new ([52cfa19](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/52cfa19))
* **dry_run flag:** added dry run flag to creating & updating datasets ([ef2d5ca](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/ef2d5ca))
* **p2p local streams:** add local streams to QriNode for local stdio interaction ([53ff3fd](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/53ff3fd))



<a name="0.5.2"></a>
# [0.5.2](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.5.1...v0.5.2) (2018-09-14)


Most of 0.5.2 is under-the-hood changes that make qri work better. We've put a _lot_ of time into our test suite & refactoring our existing code, which will set the stage for dev work to move a little faster in the coming weeks :smile:

### :truck: IPFS repo migration
We've updated our IPFS dependencies from go-ipfs 0.4.15 to 0.4.17. Between those verions the structure of IPFS repositories changed, and as such need to be migrated. If this is your first time installing Qri, you won't have an issue, but if you're coming from Qri 0.5.1 or earlier you'll see a message after upgrading that'll explain you'll need to install go-ipfs to update your repo. We know this is, well, not fun, but it's the safest way to ensure the integrity of your underlying IPFS repo.

<a name="0.5.1"></a>
# [0.5.1](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.5.1-rc1...v0.5.1) (2018-07-19)

Ok ok so now we have a formal 0.5.1 release. Maybe this should be 0.6.0 given the magnitude of visualizations, but meh, we're calling it a patch.

#### :bar_chart: Delight in Data with HTML-template visualizations
For a little while we've been experimenting with the `qri render` as a way to template data into html. The more we've played with it, the more we've come to rely on it. So much so, that we think templates should become a native component of datasets. For this we've added a new section to the dataset definition called `viz`, which is where you specify a custom template. a `dataset.yaml` file that specifies viz will look something like this (These details are always available with the handy `qri export --blank`):

```
# use viz to provide custom a HTML template of your dataset
# the currently accepted syntax is 'html'
# scriptpath is the path to your template, relative to this file:
# viz:
#   syntax: html
#   scriptpath: template.html
```

A template can only be a single file. So your template can't reference a local "style.css" file for now. _But!_ You're more than welcome to write HTML that grabs external resources, like getting jQuery or D3, or your favourite charting library off a CDN.

When you supply a template, the Dataset itself is handed back to you, and we use golang's `html/template` package to render. Here's a simplified example:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>{{ .Meta.Title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ .Meta.Description }}</p>
    <ul>
    {{ range .Body }}
      <li>{{ . }}</li>
    {{ end }}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

This would print the Title & Description from your dataset's metadata. If your dataset was a list of strings, each entry would be printed out as a list item.

#### Moar Better Frontend
We're so into viz, we've completely overhauled the frontend to put custom templates front-and-center for datasets. Be sure to take the new frontend for a spin by visiting `http://localhost:2505` while `qri connect` is running.

We've chosen to invest time in viz because we think it brings an important moment of delight to datasets. Without it, all of this _data_ stuff just feels like work. There's something truly magical about seeing your data rendered in a custom page that makes all the munging worthwhile.


### Bug Fixes

* **get:** fix get command not accepting ds refs ([fc2a2b2](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/fc2a2b2)), closes [#492](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/issues/492)
* **peers:** If user is not connected, show error instead of segfaulting. ([80b1e3e](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/80b1e3e))
* **rpc:** Register types with gob to avoid "reading body EOF" errors ([011f4bd](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/commit/011f4bd))

# [0.5.0](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0) (2018-06-18)

Who needs patch releases!? In version 0.5.0 we're introducing an initial search implementation, a few new commands, rounding out a bunch of features that warrant a minor version bump with some breaking changes. Because of these breaking changes, datasets created with v0.4.0 or earler will need to be re-created to work properly with this version.

#### :mag: Registry Search Alpha
We're still hard at work on getting registries right (more on that in the coming weeks), but for now we've shipped an initial command "qri search", that'll let you search registries for datasets. The way we see search working in the future is leveraging registries to build indexes of published datasets so you can easily search for datasets that have been published. We have a lot of work to do around making sure those datasets are available for download, but feel free to play with the command to get a feel for where we're headed with search.

#### use & get commands
working with the command line, it can get really irritating to constantly re-type the name of a dataset. To help with this, we've added a new command: `qri use`, which takes it's inspiration from database "use" commands that set the current database. `qri use` takes any number of dataset references as arguments, and once a user has set a selection with qri use, they become the default dataset names when no selection is made.

Around qri HQ we've all come to love the ease of working with the `qri config` command. `qri config get` shows either the whole configuration, or you can provide a dot.separated.path to scope down the section of config to show. `qri get` takes this idea an applies it to datasets. `qri get meta.title me/dataset_name` will get the title from metadata, and like the config command, it's output can be switched from YAML (default) to JSON. `qri get` also accepts multiple datasets, which will be combined into 

#### new skylark html module
We're still working on a proper html module for skylark transforms with an API that pythonists will be familiar with, but in the meantime we've added in a basic jquery-like selector syntax for working with HTML documents.

#### "Data" is now "Body"
This is a breaking change we've been hoping to get in sooner-rather-than-later that renames the `Data` field of a dataset to `Body`. From here on in we'll refer to the _body_ of a dataset as it's principle content. We think this language helps show how datasets are like webpages, and cutw down on use of an ambiguous term like "data".

#### Thinking about qri as an importable library
Finally, in what is more of a symbolic change than anything else, we've renamed the `core` package to `lib` to get us to start thinking about qri as an importable library. Next week we'll publish a new project aimed at writing tutorials & docs with an associated test suite built around datasets that uses qri as a library. We hope to use this project to mature the `lib` package for this use case.


### Bug Fixes

# [0.4.0](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/compare/v0.3.2...v0.4.0) (2018-06-06)

_We're going to start writing proper release notes now, so, uh, here are those notes:_

This release brings a big new feature in the form of our first transformation implementation, and a bunch of refinements that make the experience of working with qri a little easier. 

#### Introducing Skylark Transformations
For months qri has had a planned feature set for embedding the concept of "transformations" directly into datasets. Basically transforms are scripts that auto-generate datasets. We've defined a "transformation" to be a repeatable process that takes zero or more datasets and data sources, and outputs exactly one dataset. By embedding transformations directly into datasets, users can repeat them with a single command, keeping the code that updates a dataset, and it's resulting data in the same place. This opens up a whole new set of uses for qri datasets, making them auditable, repeatable, configurable, and generally _functional_. Using transformations, qri can check to see if your dataset is out of date, and update it for you.

While we've had the _plan_ for transformations for some time now, it's taken us a long time to figure out how to write a first implementation. Because transformations are executable code, security & behavioural expectations are a big concern. We also want to set ourselves up for success by choosing an implementation that will feel familiar to those who do a lot of code-based data munging, while also leaving the door open to things we'd like to do in the future like parallelized execution.

So after a lot of research and a false-start or five, we've decided on a scripting language called _skylark_ as our base implementation, which has grown out of the _bazel_ project at google. This choice might seem strange at first (bazel is a build tool and has nothing to do with data), but skylark has a number of advantages:
* **python-like syntax** - _many_ people working in data science these days write python, we like that.
* **deterministic subset of python** - unlike python, skylark removes properties that reduce introspection into code behaviour. things like `while` loops and recursive functions are omitted, making it possible for qri to infer how a given transformation will behave.
* **parallel execution** - thanks to this deterministic requirement (and lack of global interpreter lock) skylark functions can be executed in parallel. Combined with peer-2-peer networking, we're hoping to advance tranformations toward peer-driven distribed computing. More on that in the coming months.

A tutorial on how to write skylark transformations is forthcoming, we'll post examples to our documentation site when it's ready: https://qri.io/docs

#### dataset.yaml, and more :heart: for the CLI
For a while now we've been thinking about datasets as being a lot like web pages. Web pages have `head`,`meta` and `body` elements. Datasets have `meta`, `structure`, `commit`, and `data`. To us this metaphor helps reason about the elements of a dataset, why they exist, and their function. And just like how webpages are defined in `.html` files, we've updated the CLI to work with `.yaml` files that define dataests. `qri export --blank` will now write a blank dataset file with comments that link to documentation on each section of a dataset. You can edit that file, save it, and run `qri add --dataset=dataset.yaml me/my_dataset` to add the dataset to qri. Ditto for `qri update`.

We'd like to encourage users to think in terms of these `dataset.yaml` files, building up a mental model of each element of a dataset in much the same way we think about HTML page elements. We chose `yaml` over JSON specifically because we can include comments in these files, making it easier to pass them around with tools outside of qri, and we're hoping this'll make it easier to think about datasets moving forward. In futures release we plan to rename the "data" element to "body" to bring this metaphor even closer.

Along with `dataset.yaml`, we've also done a bunch of refactoring & bug fixes to make the CLI generally work better, and look forward to improving on this trend in near-term patch releases. One of the biggest things we'd like to improve upon is providing more meaningful error messages.
